Despite finding the wet notes, indicating Hari had attempted to run away with his money, Anil chose not to confront him directly. Instead, he handed Hari a fifty-rupee note, implying a salary, and simply stated he would teach him to write full sentences.\n\nThis 'non-addressal' was Anil's genius. A direct confrontation might have shamed Hari, possibly pushing him back to his old ways or causing him to flee permanently. By acting as if nothing had happened, Anil gave Hari dignity and a chance for redemption. He showed trust rather than anger, subtly conveying that he knew but still believed in Hari. This silent forgiveness and continued faith profoundly impacted Hari, initiating a genuine change of heart and inspiring him to pursue an honest life and education, something no amount of scolding could have achieved. Anil's approach nurtured Hari's conscience and transformed him.",
