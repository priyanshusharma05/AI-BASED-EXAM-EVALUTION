However, Anil chose not to confront Hari directly. Instead, he maintained his composure, gave Hari money the next morning (including the usual daily payment, even a little extra), and continued teaching him. By not addressing the theft verbally or explicitly, Anil demonstrated immense trust, forgiveness, and an understanding of human fallibility. This silent act of mercy and continued faith was far more impactful than any confrontation, prompting Hari Singh to genuinely reform and choose an honest path, proving that true reform comes through empathy and trust, not punishment or accusation.",
