    "student_answer": "Q8.1 (i): 'Dust of snow' is a beautiful poem written by 'Robert Frost' illustrating the beauty of nature. Initially in the poem, the poet was feeling melancholic and highly despondent. He was wasting his time in grief. The images of crow, hemlock tree and snow has been used by the poet for positive effect. Though these images are seen as harbingers of doom and bad omen, the poet uses them as a catalyst for positive change. The falling of snow from a hemlock tree that too by action of a crow, makes the poet happy for the rest of the day. This shows that whatever the event may be, our response to it matters.\nQ8.3 (iii): Though Custard in the poem by 'Ogden Nash' was initially thought to be a coward dragon, but to the contrary custard had all the traits of a dragon that makes it look scary and fearsome. Custard has spikes on his back and scales underneath. He could bring out fire from his mouth. He has a huge dragon with sharp teeth with which he ate the pirate. His sharp spikes, huge body, fire from the mouth, sharp claws which were compared to daggers and the smoke emitting out of his nose, all make him a fearsome and scary dragon.\nQ8.4 (iv): The poem \"For Anne Gregory\" is a poem by William Butler Yeats, signifying that everyone except God love people for only the outer appearance but not their inner beauty. The speaker mentions God in the poem to give it a spiritual dimension. The speaker says that he met a man who said that only divine love, that is, the type of love shown by God is the only form of love that is free from the glamour and outer beauty. God love people for their inner beauty and not like people who are tempted towards the outer glamour, show and shine.\nQ8.5 (v): Gautama Buddha's story stands true for each and every person on this earth regardless of their social and political status. The people in positions and power think themselves as the rulers of the world. But they forget that whoever has taken birth on this earth has to die one day. Humans are mortal. All their power, position as well as wealth will be left behind once they die. Buddha believes that only good deeds of a person remains with him always. According to Buddha, we should not be self-centered in our life because that is the truth of life that no one can escape the cycle of life. Wise people are those who do not grieve.",
    "teacher_answer": "Q8.1 (i): Initially, the poet is in a melancholic or despondent mood. Images like the 'hemlock tree' and the 'crow,' traditionally associated with negativity, are paradoxically used to reflect this mood and then become catalysts for a positive change in the poet's perspective.\nQ8.3 (iii): Custard appears fearsome due to his physical attributes: he has big, sharp teeth, spikes on his back, scales underneath his body, a mouth like a fireplace breathing fire, a nose like a chimney, and claws sharp as daggers, despite his timid nature.\nQ8.4 (iv): The speaker mentions God to emphasize that only divine love is unconditional, looking beyond superficial physical appearance (like Anne's golden hair) to the inner soul, unlike human love which often prioritizes external beauty.\nQ8.5 (v): Buddha's story teaches those in power and privilege that suffering, loss, and death are universal and inescapable, regardless of status. It highlights the impermanence of worldly possessions and power, promoting humility, compassion, and the wisdom of accepting inevitable losses without excessive grief.",

    "student_answer": "Q9.1 (i): It is rightly said that 'scientists contribute to make the world a better place to live'. But Griffin, on the contrary, was an antithesis to this statement. Griffin discovered a rare drug that could make people invisible. He took that drug to become invisible. Griffin was a brilliant scientist but he was not a good person. He did not use his invention to help people, but to satisfy his own ego and do satanic deeds. He was a lawless person. His invention could be used to help his country as well as to bring fame for himself but he did not use it the right way. Patience would have been an asset for Griffin as would have common sense! Griffin was a scientist as well as a person prone to anger which proved to be a dangerous combination for him as well as the people around him.\nQ9.2 (ii): Bholi's teacher felt like an artist admiring her masterpiece. This statement holds true according to the story of Bholi. Bholi was like a dumb cow. She used to stammer and was ugly with pock marks on her face. Luckily, she was sent to school on the demand of the Tehsildar. At school, it was Bholi's teacher who helped her gain confidence. When Bholi was being married off to an old man, she did not say anything. But when the old man demanded dowry, she was against it and spoke against it infront of everyone. Everyone was shocked to hear Bholi speaking without stammering. Her teacher played a crucial role in transforming her. Her teacher was proud that Bholi chose to live a dignified life rather than surrendering herself to a greedy man. It was Bholi's teacher who helped her transform from a dumb cow to a confident woman, that is, from Bholi - the simpleton to 'Sulekha'.",

    "student_answer": "Childhood memories remind us of the days gone by. Memories help us to relive our young days. But, not everyone wants to remember their past, maybe because of the hardships they faced. Childhood of narrator in Goa. The narrator had a beautiful and a worth remembering childhood in Goa. The sound of the baker's bamboo made him wake up and rush towards them. The narrator still remembers the beautiful smell of the breads and cakes which he was fond of. The narrator shares beautiful memories of his past, and also about the breads of Goa. Childhood of Nelson Mandela. Nelson Mandela thought his childhood to be free but the freedom he experienced was just an illusion for the members of his race. He had spent his childhood in one of the most harshest and inhumane societies of the world. They were treated as slaves. There was racial domination of dark skinned people in their own land. Comparison. From the lives of both the narrators, we come to know that the narrator in Goa had enjoyed his childhood days and was free to do whatever he wanted whereas Nelson Mandela suffered from racial discrimination and spent his life fighting for equal rights. While the narrator of 'A Baker in Goa' has sweet memories which everyone would want to live, on the contrary, Nelson Mandela faced many hardships and challenges in his life. No one would like to remember such a harsh past in their lives.",
    "teacher_answer": "The Goan narrator experienced a joyous, carefree childhood filled with pleasant community memories like the baker's arrival, signifying innocence and simple pleasures. In stark contrast, Nelson Mandela's childhood, though initially seeming free, was profoundly impacted by the harsh realities of racial discrimination and systemic oppression under apartheid. The former enjoyed personal freedom and cultural richness, while the latter faced collective struggle, fighting for basic human rights and true liberty from a young age.

    "student_answer": "'The Thief's story' is an amazing story which shows us the importance of trust and values. Hari Singh was a thief. He started living at Anil's house to rob him. He befriended Anil and soon gained his trust. When Anil got a payment of six hundred rupees, he kept it under his mattress. At night while Anil was sleeping, Hari Singh slipped his hand under the mattress and stole the money. But he could not run forth with the money. His conscience pricked him as he did not want to break Anil's trust. He felt guilty and came back home with the money which by then had been damp due to rain. He put the soggy notes back at the place from where he retrieved it. Anil, the next day, on knowing everything didn't react. Even on knowing about this incidence, he accepted Hari with open hands. This shows us the importance of values. Values can even change a bad person. Sympathy, education and good behaviour are capable of changing a criminal into a good person. Though circumstances made Hari a criminal, Anil understood his position and decided to educate him. It was Anil's trust and good behaviour which brought Hari back on the good path. Thus the statement, 'Anil successfully addressed the situation by not addressing it at all'.",
    "teacher_answer": "Anil's silent reaction upon discovering the stolen and subsequently returned money was a powerful act of non-confrontation that successfully reformed Hari. Instead of scolding or punishing, Anil's quiet forgiveness, continued trust, and subtle encouragement through the offer of education deeply appealed to Hari's conscience and self-respect. This non-verbal communication conveyed immense understanding and faith, proving more impactful than any direct accusation in leading Hari to abandon his thieving ways and choose an honest life. Anil's wisdom lay in addressing the underlying human element rather than just the crime.",
