Elaborate in about 40 words. 2\n(iv) Which phrase would correctly substitute 'quiet rage' in the given sentence from the extract: 1\nThe few steps of his cage on pads of velvet quiet in his 'quiet rage.'",
          "model_answer": "(i) In the zoo, the tiger is confined to a small cage, taking only a few steps, whereas in its natural habitat, it would be free to lurk in shadows and slide through long grass, covering vast distances.\n(ii) The speaker insinuates that the tiger's natural behavior involves asserting its dominance and being a predator at the boundaries of its territory, instilling fear in human settlements near its jungle habitat. It highlights its wild, untamed nature.\n(iii) The poet uses imagery like \"vivid stripes\" and \"pads of velvet quiet\" to show the tiger's majestic appearance, immediately contrasting it with \"the few steps of his cage.\" This confinement, coupled with \"quiet rage,\" vividly conveys the animal's frustration and suppressed power, robbed of its natural freedom.\n(iv) The phrase 'suppressed fury' or 'controlled anger' would correctly substitute 'quiet rage'.",

          "model_answer": "(i) (B) Sympathetic, understanding the depth of the boy's loss\n(ii) The extract uses the lost ball as a metaphor for the loss of innocence, childhood, and the initial realization of responsibility in a material world. The 'world of possessions' symbolizes the adult world where loss is inevitable and things cannot always be bought back.\n(iii) The phrase 'all his young days into the harbour' refers to the boy watching not just his ball, but all his cherished childhood memories and experiences associated with that ball, metaphorically disappearing into the water. It signifies the emotional weight of his loss.\n(iv) The boy's journey begins with \"shaking grief\" over losing his ball, representing the deep emotional impact of his first significant loss. This intense sadness, however, evolves into a crucial learning moment as he comprehends the permanence of loss and the concept of responsibility in a materialistic world, realizing that some things cannot be replaced by money.",

          "model_answer": "Childhood memories remind us of the days gone by and often shape our adult perspectives, yet they can be starkly different. The narrator's childhood in 'A Baker from Goa' evokes idyllic, nostalgic memories of a peaceful, community-oriented life. He recalls the friendly baker, the aroma of bread, and the simple joys of growing up in a close-knit Goan society, free from severe hardships or discrimination. His childhood was marked by innocence, warmth, and culinary delights, a period of secure normalcy.\n\nConversely, Nelson Mandela's childhood, as depicted in 'Long Walk to Freedom', was profoundly influenced by the oppressive reality of apartheid in South Africa. While he had a traditional tribal upbringing and moments of youthful freedom, his early life was soon overshadowed by racial segregation and injustice. His path diverged sharply towards activism and struggle for freedom, rather than simple pleasures. Thus, while both experienced childhood, the fundamental societal structures and personal experiences of joy versus systemic oppression created vastly different foundational memories.",

She fabricated a story about forgetting the safe's number and needing her jewels for a party, appealing to Horace's vanity and his inherent respect for 'classy' people.\n\nHer crucial maneuver to ensure no fingerprints were left involved pretending she needed the jewels urgently but had forgotten her gloves. She then convinced Horace to open the safe for her, stressing the urgency and implying that she couldn't afford a scandal if her fingerprints were found. Horace, eager to please and unknowingly trapped, willingly removed his gloves and opened the safe, leaving his fingerprints all over the scene while the lady, being the 'owner,' could touch anything without suspicion. This allowed her to escape with the jewels, leaving Horace to take the fall for the robbery.",

          "model_answer": "Hari Singh's observation, \"He knew it but neither his lips nor his eyes showed anything,\" perfectly encapsulates Anil's profound understanding and unconventional approach to handling the theft in 'The Thief's Story'. After Hari steals the money and then returns it, placing it back under the mattress, Anil undoubtedly realizes what has transpired. The wetness of the notes from the rain, combined with Hari's changed demeanor, would have been clear indicators.\n\nHowever, Anil chooses not to confront Hari directly. Instead, he addresses the situation by *not* addressing it verbally. The next morning, he simply gives Hari a fifty-rupee note, telling him he'll be paid regularly, and crucially, gives him a full meal. This act of silent forgiveness and continued trust is far more impactful than any accusation or lecture. Anil's silence and generosity convey that he understands Hari's struggle, offers him another chance, and appeals to his conscience rather than punishing him. This approach fosters a transformative change in Hari, teaching him the value of trust and respect, ultimately steering him towards an honest path, something direct confrontation would likely have failed to achieve.",
