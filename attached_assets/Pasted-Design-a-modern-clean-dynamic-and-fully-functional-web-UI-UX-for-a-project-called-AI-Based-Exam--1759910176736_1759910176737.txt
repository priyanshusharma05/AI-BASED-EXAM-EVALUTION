Design a modern, clean, dynamic, and fully functional web UI/UX for a project called “AI-Based Exam Evaluation System.”

The system has two user roles: Teacher and Student.
The UI should be built only with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, fully responsive, interactive, and visually engaging.
All buttons, links, pages, forms, animations, login/signup, and dashboard features must work perfectly.

🎯 Key Objectives:

Create a user-friendly, intuitive layout with smooth navigation.

Use modern AI-inspired colors (blues, purples, whites) and soft gradients.

Include dynamic animations, hover effects, modals, and smooth page transitions using CSS and JS.

Make the UI fully responsive across desktops, tablets, and mobiles.

Ensure all buttons and forms (login, signup, upload, submit, review) are functional and simulate real interactions.

👩‍🏫 Teacher Dashboard Features:

Upload and manage question papers/exam materials.

Evaluate student submissions using AI-based evaluation simulation.

Monitor ongoing exams and student progress in real-time.

Review submissions and provide feedback.

Visualize student performance using dynamic charts, cards, and progress bars.

All dashboard buttons (upload, evaluate, monitor, review) must work seamlessly with JS interactions.

🧑‍🎓 Student Dashboard Features:

Take exams with timer, question navigation, and dynamic exam interface.

Upload exam submissions with exam-related details.

View AI-generated results, feedback, and performance analytics.

Access past exams, scores, and progress tracking charts.

All student dashboard options (upload, view results, feedback, exam details) must function properly with JS.

💡 Core UI Components:

Landing Page → Animated header with tagline “Smarter Evaluation Through AI”.

Login/Signup Page → Functional role-based login (Teacher/Student) with smooth transitions.

Dashboards → Sidebar navigation, stat cards, dynamic charts, upload & review sections.

Exam Page (Student) → Timer, question navigation, upload submission, and interactive elements.

Results Page → Charts, score cards, feedback display, and performance insights.

Dark/Light Mode Toggle → Fully functional and responsive.

🌈 Design & Interaction Guidelines:

Rounded corners, shadows, hover animations, subtle transitions, and micro-interactions for buttons and progress indicators.

Dynamic JS-based interactions (modals, tabs, sliders, charts, file uploads).

Responsive layout using CSS Flexbox/Grid.

Typography: Clean fonts like Poppins, Inter, or Montserrat.

Ensure all forms, buttons, uploads, evaluation, monitoring, review, and feedback features simulate real interactions properly.

🧠 Your Role (UI/UX Designer):

Provide UI/UX suggestions for intuitive, engaging, and user-friendly layouts.

Enhance visual design: colors, layout balance, responsiveness, animations.

Refine frontend visuals and test UI functionality for both Teacher and Student dashboards.
